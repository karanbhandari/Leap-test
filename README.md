# Leap-test
A test Leap project for learning

I started this project in order to learn more about using Leap Motion to make websites that could be virtually controlled by the users using hand gestures.
This particular project has images that could be virtually controlled by a user using hand gestures. 

Note: A Leap Motion device is necessary
